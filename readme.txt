=== Fetch Priority Plugin ===

The Fetch Priority Plugin is a WordPress plugin that enhances the performance of your website by implementing Fetch Priority for media files. With Fetch Priority, you can prioritize the loading of critical images and videos above the fold, ensuring a faster and smoother user experience.

=== Installation ===

2. Inspect the HTML source of your header area to verify that the `fetchpriority` attribute has been added to the first three images or videos.
